TODO:
* hide the first submission and favorite elements more permanently
* use a dummy element to replace hidden element nodes so they may be hovered over without resorting to checking parent elements for viability
* add more global settings (like what?)
* add i18n locale support (requesting translators)
* add context menus to webpages that add webextension functionality (Context menus have been put on wait due to the lack of cross-browser support for both `<menu>` and `browser.contextMenus`)

		* add to filter
		* remove from filter
		* remove from all filters
	* when clicking on a submission node, options include:
