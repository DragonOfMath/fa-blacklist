TODO:
* Test in Opera/Edge/Safari
* hide the first submission and favorite elements more permanently
* use a dummy element to replace hidden element nodes so they may be hovered over without resorting to checking parent elements for viability
* add more global settings (like what?)
* Fix context menu bug in Chrome

IMPORTANT:
* request translations
* obtain an AMO signature and publish extension
